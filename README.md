## SwiftUI & CoreData
Bifocal is made using Apple's declarative SwiftUI framework for the UI and the persistence framework CoreData for storage.

Thanks to SwiftUI's philosophy of views being 'functions of state', a more rigid architecture philosophy is (for the most part) unnecessary. There are a few views where I have separated business logic into a ViewModel, following the MVVM architecture. This is where there have been multiple FetchRequests, for example, or State variables needing to be passed between numerous different views.
